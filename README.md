# Light OS Codex

**The source of Light OS.**  
Commands, rituals, and version control for a terminal interface forged in precision and style.

Maintained by [`0xzerolight`](https://github.com/0xzerolight).

## Structure

- `scripts/` – Individual command files (no sudo inside)
- `version.txt` – Current OS version and codename
- `README.md` – This file

## Commands

Each script is a ritual.

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `drift` | Enter distraction-free mode |
| `quote` | Display a random quote from the Codex |
| `requiem` | Shutdown, reboot, or suspend |
| `version` | Show current Light OS version |
| `sakujo` | Ceremonial purge of a file |
| `update` | Pull updates from this Codex and apply |

## Ritual Philosophy

- Never run commands with `sudo`.
- The system is shaped through elegance and symbolic weight.
- Every function exists because it *should*, not just because it *can*.
